# 100-days-of-js

## Introduction

This project is inspired by the many 100 Days challenges floating around the internet, such as Jennifer Dewalt's [180 Websites in 180 Days](https://jenniferdewalt.com/) project and the [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/).

The main purpose of thie project is to push myself to improve my JavaScript skills as I transition from JS 6 to JS 9. Most of my knowledge and experience with JavaScript programming is from classroom projects, which leaves me with habits and techniques that don't translate well outside of academics. At the end of these 100 days, I hope to have reinforced my knowledge of this language and gain a portfolio of projects I can either show off in the future or further develop into something more useful.
